# basic_dice_game

Hey EveryOne!

Here I have created a basic dice game page.
And for the first time i have tried using javascript in my code to bring functionalities.

1)Html 
Used basic html properties just to design the skeleton.

2)CSS
Used images and followed all the good practices to give my website an elivation by styling it.

3)Javascript
1)Used Math.random properly to generate random images whenever user refreshes the page simultaneously displaying the result of who won based on the dice which has
greater value.

Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Happy Coding!
